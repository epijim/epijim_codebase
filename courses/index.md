As a number of people have asked about courses I recommend, I decided to keep a track of them
 all here.

## Diabetes

#### Diabetes: diagnosis, treatment, and opportunities

*5 week online course provided by UCSF (via Coursera.org)*: [This course](https://www.coursera.org/course/ucsfdiabetes), provides a good introduction to
 diabetes care in practice. It's not at all intellectual[^1], and provides a relatively
 in depth listing of facts concerning what defines a patient with diabetes, what is current
 treatment norms, and what are they at risk of.

#### Diabetes

*5 week online course provided by University of Copenhagen (via Coursera.org)*: [This course](https://www.coursera.org/course/diabetes), was far superior to the UCSF course,
and covered what diabetes is, where and what burdens it creates and what current treatments
there are, and what there might be in the future.

## R

#### The Data Scientists Toolbox

*4 week online course provided by Johns Hopkins University (via Coursera.org)*: [This course](https://www.coursera.org/course/datascitoolbox),
 introducing git and R as tools for data science. Good course, although I already use git and R, and the course only teaches the basics. If you know
 how to push or fork a git, or what CRAN and a vector is (and why it gives R a huge advantage over simpler packages like R and Stata), you don't need this
 course.

#### Codeschool - Try R

*Online interactive course*: [This course](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-r) is beyond amazing. It's an introduction
 to R where you type into your browser, and it responds interactively. The free intro course is short,
 but lots of fun. Definitely the ideal first introduction to R.

#### R Programming

*4 week online course provided by Johns Hopkins University (via Coursera.org)*: [This course](https://www.coursera.org/course/rprog),
 introduced best practices in writing R scripts. The most useful aspect of this course was
 an explanation of how how scoping works in R, as that's a fundamental concept when writing
 functions.

#### Exploratory data analysis

*4 week online course provided by Johns Hopkins University (via Coursera.org)*: [This course](https://www.coursera.org/course/exdata),
 focuses on the first steps required to understand the distribution of data, and simple
 methods like k-means clustering, scatterplots and aggregation.

#### Reproducible research

*4 week online course provided by Johns Hopkins University (via Coursera.org)*: [This course](https://www.coursera.org/course/repdata),
 introduces the key tenets of reproducible research. This includes the importance
 of writing literate analysis code (via sweave, markdown, knitr, etc). Taking this
 course re-inforced for me how un-scientific the process of writing analysis 
 code is for most of my colleagues. Coupled
 with the importance of versioned analysis code this course was for me key
 in understanding what it means to write good, reproducible, research.

#### Getting and cleaning data

*4 week online course provided by Johns Hopkins University (via Coursera.org)*: [This course](https://www.coursera.org/course/getdata),
 focused on how to take dirty data, and derive a clean workable dataset. The course teaches
 are environmental research statisticians, so many of the problems they face in cleaning
 sensor data aren't as extreme in epidemiology.

## General data analysis and visualisation

#### Introduction to data visualisation

*Evening session at The Guardian*: [This is a single (paid) session](http://www.theguardian.com/guardian-masterclasses/intorduction-to-data-visualisation-digital-course)
 introducing tools used by the Guardian newspaper for their infographics.
 While the evening was very interesting, it's also a little disappointing. The Guardian appears
 to be relatively methodologically inept compared to the data journalists at places like the New York Times and ESPN.
 So not the place to go if you want to hear how to do things well.

#### Maps and the geo-spatial revolution

*5 week uncredited online course provided by Penn State (via Coursera.org)*: [A fun course](https://www.coursera.org/course/maps), that provides a basic introduction to GIS.
 I learnt lots of terminology, and some history, of GIS, but this course is targeted at people with no experience.
 If you know how to plot a path, and a point, with ggmaps in R, you're already beyond the course content.

[^1]: By 'not at all intellectual' I mean the content of the course never asks you to think, it just lists *what's what*.
